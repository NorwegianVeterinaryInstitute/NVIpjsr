## Overview

`NVIpjsr`tools for retrieving, standardising, wrangling, preparing and
reporting PJS data and EOS data. NVIpjsr was created by separating out
PJS-functions from NVIdb. Further development of and creation of new
PJS-functions will take place within NVIpjsr.

`NVIpjsr` is part of `NVIverse`, a collection of R-packages with tools
to facilitate data management and data reporting at the Norwegian
Veterinary Institute (NVI). The `NVIverse` consists of the following
packages: `NVIconfig`, `NVIdb`, `NVIpjsr`, `NVIspatial`, `NVIpretty`,
`NVIbatch`, `OKplan`, `OKcheck`, `NVIcheckmate`, `NVIpackager`,
`NVIrpackages`. See [Contribute to
NVIpjsr](https://github.com/NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute/NVIpjsr/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for more information.

## Installation

`NVIpjsr` is available at
[GitHub](https://github.com/NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute). To install
`NVIpjsr` you will need:

-   R version &gt; 4.1.0
-   R package `remotes`
-   Rtools version 4.0, 4.2, 4.3 or 4.4 depending on R version

First install and attach the `remotes` package.

    install.packages("remotes")
    library(remotes)

To install (or update) the `NVIpjsr` package without vignettes, run the
following code:

    remotes::install_github("NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute/NVIpjsr",
        upgrade = FALSE,
        build = TRUE,
        build_vignettes = FALSE)

To install (or update) the `NVIpjsr` package with vignettes, you will
need to first install some additional R-packages needed to build the
vignettes. Check README below in the section [Vignettes](#vignettes) to
see which vignettes are available. To install the package with the
vignettes, first install the packages: `knitr`, `rmarkdown`, `R.rsp`,
and `NVIrpackages` (from GitHub) if they are missing. If you donâ€™t use
R-studio, you will also need to install Pandoc. Then run the following
code:

    remotes::install_github("NorwegianVeterinaryInstitute/NVIpjsr",
        upgrade = FALSE,
        build = TRUE,
        build_vignettes = TRUE)
