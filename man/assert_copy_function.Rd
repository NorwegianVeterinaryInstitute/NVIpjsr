\title{Collection of assertions for copy_functions}
\usage{
assert_copy_function(filename, from_path, to_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Argument to the copy-function to be asserted.}

\item{from_path}{Argument to the copy-function to be asserted. Ending
"\\" and "/" should have been removed before the assertion is performed.}

\item{to_path}{Argument to the copy-function to be asserted. Ending
"\\" and "/" should have been removed before the assertion is performed.}
}
\value{
\code{TRUE} if none of the assertions failed. If any of the assertions
    failed, one or more error messages are returned.
}
\description{
Collection of assertions used in standard copy_functions.
}
\details{
All copy functions have the same arguments and the
    assertion can be standardized. The assertion of \code{filname} is
    constructed to handle both character and list input.

    The assertion is based on removing ending "\\" and "/" from
    \code{from_path} and \code{to_path} before the assertion is performed.
