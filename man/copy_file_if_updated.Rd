}
\details{
Compares the creation date of source file and target file. If the target file don't exist, the source file is copied.
    If the the creation date of the source file is later than the target file, the source file is copied and overwrites the target
    file.

    The intention of checking the creation date before copying files is to avoid unnecessary copying. Some of the source files
    may be large and by first checking the creation date computer time can be saved.
