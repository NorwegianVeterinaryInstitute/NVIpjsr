Vector with the column names for the variables that is used in the selection.}

\item{value_2_check}{[\code{character}]\cr
Vector with the values that should be selected, see details and examples.}

\description{
Selects a subset of PJSdata based on code values.
   The function accepts code values ending with "\%" to indicate
   that sub levels should be included.
}
\details{
The function is intended for cases where the select
   query sent to PJS will be very complicated if the selection
   is included and it can be easier to read the script if the
   subset is selected in a second step.

The function selects according to different values. The default
   action is to include the selected rows. But when \code{keep_selected
   = FALSE}, the selected rows are excluded from the data.
