\item{PJSdata}{Data frame with data extracted from PJS.}

\item{abroad}{If equal "exclude", samples from abroad are excluded. Allowed
values are c("exclude", "include").}

\description{
Performs common subsetting of PJS-data by excluding rows
}
\details{
Performs common cleaning of PJSdata by removing samples that usually
    should not be included when analyzing PJSdata. The cleaning is dependent
    on having the following columns: eier_lokalitettype, eier_lokalitetnr and
    hensiktkode.

    \code{abroad = "exclude"} will exclude samples that have eier_lokalitet
    of type "LAND" and eier_lokalitetnr being different from "NO". Samples
    registered on other types than "LAND" are not excluded.

    \code{quality = "exclude"} will exclude all samples registered s quality
    assurance and ring trials, i.e. hensiktkode starting with "09".

                                   quality = "exclude")
